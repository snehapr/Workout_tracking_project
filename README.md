# Workout_tracking_project
1. This project basically is used to track any workout done by user on daily basis.
2. It asks the user which workout done for how long or for how much distance etc and based on the answer given, it uses the Nutritionix API to calculate the calories burnt.
3. Finally the workout name, duration (in min) and the calories burnt are recoded in the Google sheets using the Sheety API.
4. The code is written using Python and API requests library.
5. The API key and APP ID for the Nutritionix API is different for different users and can be fetched after sign-in to the website.
6. The Auth token for the SHEETY API can be fetched after sign-in to the website.
7. Please replace these variables accordingly in the code.
